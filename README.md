OBS: This repository is not maintained since the project has been extended in https://gitlab.com/attiladoor/sigma-robot, in which the code is re-implemented and improved in Python and also contains actual hardware.

A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe where an AI is learned the play of the game via Reinforcement learning using C# in Visual Studios.

The repository contains some files based on pre-learning, but it's behavious is not optimal (it can make a few correct plays currently).
To learn it on your own, simply delete the QTable & Iterations .txt-files in the bin/debug folder and run the program (it will create the files from scratch).
